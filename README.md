```cpp
void expl() {
	cout << R"(
		Here is what I know. :)
		I understand the basics to the Git CLI and I actively use GitHub.
		I have been working on some projects based using Python && C++. One of My
		current main projects I'm working on is a Password Recovory tool called `Simple Hash`.
		I've been working on this project for about a month and a half now. If you would like to check
		out the project, I've got a repo for it on GitHub at: https://github.com/bobrossrtx/Simple-Hash
		Simple-Hash was originally made in python but that was kind of a learning curve for me since I was
		mainly working in JavaScript and React for at the time. I then decided, "I want to take a try at more strongly typed languages",
		So I decided to start to learn C++. C++ has been going pretty well, and has been a really fun language to learn. I watch
		alot of twitch, so I had some people that could help me out... I was most recently shown how to multi thread functions within C++
		and has been really helpful since.

}
```
As you can see there, I wrote that in a C++ `R"()"` string which is a multi line string in C++. I just thought that would be a cool way to explain the stuff I know at the moment. :)

Here is a simple list of languages I have at least got a bit of knowledge on:
- GoLang		([`https://github.com/bobrossrtx/learning-go`](https://github.com/bobrossrtx/learning-go) Here is what I have on GoLang)
- JavaScript
- C#

And here are the languages that I am starting to feel more strongly about:
- Python 		([`https://github.com/bobrossrtx/1st-flask`](https://github.com/bobrossrtx/1st-flask) Here is a simple flask TODO list I made)
- C++			([`https://github.com/bobrossrtx/Simple-Hash/tree/c%2B%2B`](https://github.com/bobrossrtx/Simple-Hash/tree/c%2B%2B`
) Here is the C++ branch of my Simple-Hash Tool I've been working on)
- HTML/CSS 		(If you count these 2 as programming languages)

When it comes to all of these languages, I have basically taught what I know currently all to myself.
